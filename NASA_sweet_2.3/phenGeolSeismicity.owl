    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Surface waves are analogous to water waves and travel just under the Earth's surface. They travel more slowly than body waves. Because of their low frequency, long duration, and large amplitude, they can be the most destructive type of seismic wave. There are two types of surface waves: Rayleigh waves and Love waves. Theoretically, surface waves can be understood as systems of interacting P and/or S waves.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A type of seismic surface wave having a horizontal motion that is shear or transverse to the direction of propagation. Its velocity depends only on density and rigidity modulus, and not on bulk modulus. It is named after A. E. H. Love, the English mathematician who discovered it.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">P waves are longitudinal or compressional waves, which means that the ground is alternately compressed and dilated in the direction of propagation. In solids these waves generally travel slightly less than twice as fast as S waves and can travel through any type of material. In air, these pressure waves take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound. Typical speeds are 330 m/s in air, 1450 m/s in water and about 5000 m/s in granite. P waves are sometimes called primary waves. When generated by an earthquake they are less destructive than the S waves and surface waves that follow them, due to their lesser amplitudes. </rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">S waves are transverse or shear waves, which means that the ground is displaced perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. In the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. Their speed is about 60% of that of P waves in a given material. S waves are sometimes called secondary waves, and are several times larger in amplitude than P waves for earthquake sources.</rdfs:comment>
